## LED Color States

The RGB LED indicates printer status as follows:

| Color   | Meaning                                      | Condition                                                                 |
|---------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| White   | Offline / Not connected                     | `isOnline == false`                                                      |
| Green   | Printing                                    | `isOnline == true && state == "RUNNING"`                                |
| Purple  | Idle (finished & available)                 | `isOnline == true && (state == "FINISH" or "FINISHED") && isAvailable == true` |
| Red     | Finished, not cleared (not available)       | `isOnline == true && (state == "FINISH" or "FINISHED") && isAvailable == false` |
| Off     | Unknown/other state                         | Any other state                                                          |
