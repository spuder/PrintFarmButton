## Setup

```
cd firmware/esphome
esphome compile config.yaml
esphome upload config.yaml
```

Then join the `openqueue` wifi network and navigate to 192.168.4.1
Enter your wifi credentials and wait for it to reboot

Once you've joined it to your wifi, navigate to `http://openqueue.local` or find the ip address. 

## Hardware

### Required Components
- ESP32-S3-Zero board
- RGB LED connected to GPIO1
- Physical button connected to GPIO2
- 3D printed enclosure (see `/hardware` folder for STL files)

### Wiring
1. Connect the RGB LED:
   - Data pin to GPIO1 on the ESP32-S3-Zero
   - Power pin to 5V
   - Ground pin to GND
2. Connect the physical button between GPIO2 and GND on the ESP32-S3-Zero
   - One terminal of the button connects to GPIO2
   - The other terminal connects to GND
3. Power the ESP32-S3-Zero via USB or an external 5V power supply
