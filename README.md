Open Source Andon light for 3d printers. 
See the state of your prints with a physical LED & microcontroller. With the push of a button you can mark your print plate as clear and ready for the next print in the queue. 

## Supported Print Queues

| Print Queue     | Status        |
|-----------------|--------------|
| printago.io     | ‚úÖ Supported  |
| simplyprint     | üïµÔ∏è Evaluating |
| 3dprinteros     | üïµÔ∏è Evaluating |
| autofarm        | üïµÔ∏è Evaluating |

## Setup

```
cd firmware/esphome
esphome compile config.yaml
esphome upload config.yaml
```

You will see a new wifi network named `printfarmbutton-xxxx`. Join the network and navigate to [192.168.4.1](http://192.168.4.1)
Enter your wifi credentials and wait for it to reboot. 

Once you've joined it to your wifi, navigate to `http://printfarmbutton-xxxxxx.local` or find the ip address. 

## Hardware

### Required Components
- ESP32-S3-Zero board
- RGB LED connected to GPIO1 (5v, 144 Leds per meter)
- Physical button connected to GPIO2
- 3D printed enclosure (see `/hardware` folder for STL files)

#### Links

[Esp32-S3-Zero](https://amzn.to/44gplMl)  
[LED Strip](https://amzn.to/44uVFMB)  

### Wiring
1. Connect the RGB LED:
   - Data pin to GPIO1 on the ESP32-S3-Zero
   - Power pin to 5V
   - Ground pin to GND
2. Connect the physical button between GPIO2 and GND on the ESP32-S3-Zero
   - One terminal of the button connects to GPIO2
   - The other terminal connects to GND
3. Power the ESP32-S3-Zero via USB or an external 5V power supply

### Pinout Reference
| Component      | ESP32-S3-Zero Pin |
|----------------|-------------------|
| RGB LED data   | GPIO1             |
| RGB LED power  | 5V                |
| RGB LED ground | GND               |
| Button         | GPIO2 and GND     |

## Firmware

To flash, ensure you have the `esphome` cli installed (`brew install esphome`)

```bash
cd firmware/esphome
esphome run config.yaml
```

To update remotely for a specific board type (e.g., ESP32-C3), set the BOARD_TYPE environment variable:

```bash
export BOARD_TYPE=esp32-c3
esphome run config.yaml --device printfarmbutton-xxxx
```
Or in a single command:
```bash
BOARD_TYPE=esp32-c3 esphome run config.yaml --device printfarmbutton-xxxx
```

## Building Firmware

This project supports multiple ESP32 board types (S3 and C3) using a modular ESPHome configuration.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) installed (`pip install esphome`)

### Build for ESP32-S3
```
BOARD_TYPE=esp32-s3 esphome compile firmware/esphome/config.yaml
```

### Build for ESP32-C3
```
BOARD_TYPE=esp32-c3 esphome compile firmware/esphome/config.yaml
```

### Output
- Compiled binaries will be found in `.esphome/build/` or as moved by the GitHub Actions workflow to `firmware/build/`.
- The correct binary for each board is referenced in `firmware/build/manifest.json` for use with ESP Web Tools.

### GitHub Actions
Firmware for both boards is built automatically on each push to `main` via GitHub Actions. Artifacts and the manifest are committed to `firmware/build/`.
